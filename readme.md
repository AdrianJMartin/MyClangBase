VSCode Clang Windows
====

Base file for LLDB/CLANG on Windows using VSCODE

Attempting to set up a build task and a launch debug task

Requires:
    VSCode!
    LLVM/CLANG installed and on PATH
    Clangd extensions - LLVM own language server
    CodeLLDB - the only lldb extension I could get to work, requires Python3 64.
